## Deadchest 4.29.0 - 2026-07-25

- Fixed the item duplication caused by a server killed without a clean shutdown (out of memory kill, `kill -9`, host crash).
  The plugin database was written at death while the vanilla player file was not, so the player came back with the items still
  in the inventory AND a deadchest holding a copy of them. Deaths and chest recoveries are now stamped on both sides and only
  completed once the player data reached the disk, and a transfer left half done by a crash is settled at the next login.
- Added `integrity.crash-protection`, `integrity.flush-player-data` and `integrity.on-rollback` to configure that behavior
- Fixed items being destroyed when a deadchest could not be stored: the generation is now rolled back and vanilla drops apply
- Fixed items being duplicated when a chest expired or was given back while the database write was still pending
- Fixed a chest content being handed over twice by two interactions on the same chest
- Fixed two deadchests sharing the same block, which left an unreachable row behind and could delete the wrong chest
- Fixed deletions targeting a chest by position, which could remove a different chest stored on the same block
- Database failures are now logged instead of being silently swallowed, and committed writes are flushed to disk

## Deadchest 4.28.0 - 2026-03-21

- Added a two-phase loot system with a private phase (`chest.duration-seconds`) and an optional public loot phase (`chest.loot.*`)
- Added configurable public-phase access rules for owner, killer, and other players
- Added public-phase expiration handling with dedicated timeout behavior
- Added a dedicated hologram status line above the owner name
- Added Minecraft-friendly hologram states: `PRIVATE`, `OPEN`, `PUBLIC`, `KILLER`, `OWNER`, and `SHARE`

## Deadchest 4.25.0 - 2026-03-10

- YAML Configuration Overhaul
The config.yml structure has been fully reorganized for better clarity and easier maintenance.
Settings are now grouped into clear sections (localization, visuals, sound, gameplay, permissions, etc.).
This makes customization faster and reduces configuration mistakes.

- Localization System Upgrade
The localization system has been redesigned to be cleaner and more consistent across the plugin.
Built-in languages: en, fr, es, de, it, pl, pt-br, zh-cn.
Migration from legacy localization/config systems is handled automatically, so existing setups are updated without manual conversion.

- DeadChest Visual Customization
Added configurable standing chest effects (style, radius, speed, enable/disable).
Added configurable pickup animation (particle type, count, spread, speed, vertical offset).
Added configurable pickup sound (enable/disable, sound name, volume, pitch).
